## 📚 What I Learned
- Structuring content using semantic HTML (`main`, `article`, `footer`)
- Centering layouts properly without breaking responsiveness
- Using `max-width` instead of fixed widths
- Understanding margins vs padding in centered layouts

## 🚀 Continued Improvements
- Add smoother hover and focus states
- Improve accessibility further (ARIA, better contrast)
- Refactor CSS for even better readability
